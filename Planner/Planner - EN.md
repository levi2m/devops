# Azure Kubernetes Implementation with GitOps and Flux v2

This repository contains information and tutorials for implementing GitOps with Flux v2 in an Azure Kubernetes cluster. GitOps is a methodology for managing configuration and deployment of applications for Kubernetes that uses Git as the source of truth. Flux v2 is a GitOps tool that automates application deployment and synchronization of Git configurations with a Kubernetes cluster.

The objectives of these documentations are:

-   Provide an overview of the GitOps methodology and how it can be used to manage configuration and deployment of applications in an Azure Kubernetes cluster.
-   Describe how to install and configure Flux v2 in an Azure Kubernetes cluster.
-   Guide users on how to deploy applications in an Azure Kubernetes cluster using Flux v2 and GitOps.

The tutorials include detailed instructions on how to create a Git repository, install Flux v2, and deploy applications using GitOps. These tutorials are designed to help users understand and implement GitOps in an Azure Kubernetes cluster environment.

By following these instructions, users can deploy applications quickly and reliably in an Azure Kubernetes cluster. The GitOps methodology helps ensure that application configuration is maintained in a consistent and secure state across all environments, making the deployment process more efficient and reducing the risk of human error.

We hope that these documentations will be helpful for users who are implementing an Azure Kubernetes cluster and want to take advantage of the benefits of GitOps and Flux v2 for managing configuration and deployment of applications.
